## Implementation Notes

1. **Prioritization**: Focus on Phase 1 tasks first as they provide the foundation for all other improvements
2. **Testing**: Write tests alongside refactoring to ensure no functionality is broken
3. **Incremental Changes**: Break large tasks into smaller, reviewable chunks
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as changes are implemented
5. **Team Communication**: Coordinate with team members on breaking changes and new patterns

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 10 weeks
- **Developer Effort**: 2-3 hours per day
- **Critical Path**: Testing infrastructure → TypeScript fixes → Component refactoring → Performance optimization
